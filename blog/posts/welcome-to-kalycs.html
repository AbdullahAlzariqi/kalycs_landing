<p><strong>Kalycs</strong> is your local-first file companion: it keeps things organized, finds what you need fast, and turns documents into instant, grounded answers.</p>

<h2>Local-first by design</h2>
<p>Your files stay on your device. When you enable AI features, only the minimal context you select is sent to providers you configure with your own key.</p>

<h2>What you can do today</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ask natural-language questions and get answers with citations.</li>
  <li>Search by meaning, not just keywords.</li>
  <li>Auto‑organize your Downloads with rules or suggestions.</li>
  <li>Keep projects tidy with simple views and quick actions.</li>
  <li>Process and prepare files for accurate, grounded results.</li>
  <li>Store embeddings locally for speed and privacy.</li>
  <li>Use your own OpenAI key for AI features.</li>
  <li>Work offline for local features.</li>
  <li>Enjoy a clean, fast, desktop‑native experience.</li>
  <li>See the roadmap for what’s next.</li>
  <li>Request features directly from the app and site.</li>
  <li>Get focused: less hunting, more doing.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop searching. Start finding. Our goal is clarity and momentum — so the files you have become answers you trust.</p>
</blockquote>
