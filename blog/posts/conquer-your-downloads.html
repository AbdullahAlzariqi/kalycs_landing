<p>Downloads get messy. In Kalycs, you can <strong>auto‑organize</strong> that folder with a few simple rules — or let suggestions help you.</p>

<h2>Set up in minutes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open Kalycs and go to Settings → Organization.</li>
  <li>Enable “Watch Downloads”.</li>
  <li>Add a couple of rules, e.g. “PDF → /Documents/Receipts”.</li>
  <li>Optionally enable suggestions to review before applying.</li>
  <li>Relax — new files file themselves where they belong.</li>
  <li>Adjust rules as your needs evolve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start broad: file type and size catch most clutter.</li>
  <li>Refine over time with keywords or date ranges.</li>
  <li>Keep it simple — fewer, clearer rules beat many complex ones.</li>
</ul>
